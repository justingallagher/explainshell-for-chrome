## Authors

This project is being developed by Jake Zimmerman, Justin Gallagher, Ted Li, and Howard Chen as a part of the final project for 15-221 Technical Communications for Computer Scientists.

## Directory Structure

Right now the directory structure is very basic. 

- The `handout/` directory contains documents describing the requirements for various phases (mirrored here for the sake of convenience). PDFs are preferred to MS Office files.
- The `docs/` directory contains planning documents, written assignments, and presentation slides.

More directories will be added as there becomes more solid content to be managed.

## explainshell.com

explainshell.com is a project by [idank](/idank) that parses shell commands, finds the revelant pieces of documentation for the commands, flags, and syntax, and displays them to the user. This chrome extension allows you to click on commands from within chrome and jump to their documentation on explainshell.com for a seamless workflow. If you haven't already, you should check out [his project](/idank/explainshell) on GitHub as well!
