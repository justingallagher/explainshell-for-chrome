# ExplainShell for Chrome

A Chrome extension for quickly grokking bash snippets

## Table of Contents

## Problem

- Random code snippets pose threat to unsuspecting web users
    - people have a risk of running malicious or insecure commands
- Often difficult to look through `man` pages for relevant documentation
- sites like [explainshell.com][es] make this easier, but thereâ€™s still a barrier
    - have to copy, navigate to another page, paste

## Approach

1. in-page link to jump to explainshell.com
